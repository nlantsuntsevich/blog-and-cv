How do take an already amazing theme like [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) and make it better? Yup, dark-mode[^1]. That and some more changes under the hood is what led to this theme called Tail (as a hat tip to the original theme of course)

<!--more-->

## What's new in Tail
- Dark Mode
- Support for posts without the `YYYY-MM-DD` in post's filename
- Bi-directional Wiki-style linking support compatible with Obsidian (Planned)

## Some great features from the original Tale
- Compatible with GitHub Pages
- Responsive design (looks just as good on mobile)
- Syntax highlighting, with the help of Pygments
- Markdown and HTML text formatting
- Pagination of posts
- Sticky posts
- Tags
- Excerpt management
- Disqus comments

### Footnotes

[^1]: For now, there is no toggle button for the dark mode. This is by design. I wanted the dark-mode to be on if the browser or system level dark-mode is enabled. Maybe, in a later version, I will add support for a dark/light toggle. Happy to accept a PR!
